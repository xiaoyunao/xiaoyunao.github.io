excerpt: "We present the identification of changing-look active galactic nuclei (CL-AGNs) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument First Data Release and Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 16 at z ≤ 0.9. To confirm the CL-AGNs, we utilize spectral flux calibration assessment via an [O III]-based calibration, pseudo-photometry examination, and visual inspection. This rigorous selection process allows us to compile a statistical catalog of 561 CL-AGNs, encompassing 527 $\\text{H}\\beta$, 149 $\\text{H}\\alpha$, and 129 Mg II CL behaviors.<br>
In this sample, we find:<br>
1. A 283:278 ratio of turn-on to turn-off CL-AGNs.<br>
2. The critical value for CL events is confirmed around Eddington ratio ~ 0.01.<br>
3. A strong correlation between the change in the luminosity of the broad emission lines (BEL) and variation in the continuum luminosity, with Mg II and Hβ displaying similar responses during CL phases.<br>
4. The Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich diagram for CL-AGNs shows no statistically significant difference from the general AGN catalog.<br>
5. Five CL-AGNs are associated with asymmetrical mid-infrared flares, possibly linked to tidal disruption events.<br>
Given the large number of CL-AGNs and the stochastic sampling of spectra, we propose that some CL events are inherently due to typical AGN variability during low accretion rates, particularly for CL events of the singular BEL. Finally, we introduce a Peculiar CL phase, characterized by a gradual decline over decades in the light curve and the complete disappearance of entire BEL in faint spectra, indicative of a real transition in the accretion disk."
