This course introduces the basic observational equipment and methods used in astrophysical observations across various electromagnetic wave bands from a practical observational perspective. It aims to train graduate students in astronomy to understand the acquisition and processing of observational data in modern astrophysics, promote the organic integration of astronomical observation with mathematical and physical knowledge, and expand students' knowledge in astrophysics. The course covers practical astrophysical methods, including data acquisition, processing, and analysis, with each topic featuring hands-on assignments for data processing. This training is designed to develop essential research skills for graduate students in astronomy and lay a solid professional foundation for their future research in astrophysics. I work with Prof. Hu Zou, responsible for teaching photometric and spectral observations in the optical and infrared bands.<br>
As a teaching assistant, my primary role is to guide students through practical optical observations and the processing of optical data. This includes hands-on training in data acquisition, calibration, and various analysis methods, ensuring students gain valuable experience in reducing and interpreting astronomical data effectively.
